# Introduction

<p align='justify'>
DIVE CLI â€“ a powerful tool designed to streamline the entire process of node setup, network configuration, and bridge creation.
With DIVE CLI, developers can easily connect and interact with various blockchain networks, paving the way for seamless cross-chain communication and smart contract deployment.
Serving as an all-in-one solution, DIVE CLI eliminates the hassle of manually configuring nodes, allowing developers to effortlessly set up nodes for the bridge networks with just a few simple commands. The tool provides a user-friendly interface that makes the process accessible even to those new to blockchain development.
</p>

## About

The Dive CLI aim to implement its services and API for various Blockchains. The kurtosis services and API are designed to simplify the process of deploying various nodes and services for development and testing and enhance the overall user experience. Implementing kurtosis for the ICON blockchain can help ease the developers in the ecosystem to focus more on building the business logic without worrying about the setup which consumes a significant amount of time.

The vision is to making ICON the interoperable hub by easing the setup of BTP and IBC for ICON and the connecting chains.

# Usage 

> Before proceeding, make sure the Kurtosis Engine is running in the background. If it's not already running, start it by executing the following command: `kurtosis engine start`

## Setting up a Node

To set up an individual node, simply pass the name of the chain to the dive chain command:

```bash
dive chain archway
```

After running the command, **DIVE CLI** will automatically start the Archway node and handle the necessary initialization processes. Please wait for the Archway node to fully initialize, which may take a few moments.

Once the initialization is complete, you can interact with the local Archway chain as needed.**DIVE CLI** sets up the Archway node on your local environment, enabling you to deploy and test smart contracts, explore transactions, and experiment with various Archway blockchain features

> Detailed output during execution can be enabled via Verbose flag.

> example: `dive chain archway --verbose`

> Each Dive cli execution will be logged into log files under log folder in current working directory.

After successful execution service details can be found in `services_xxxx_xxxx123xx.json`. For more details, refer to the [Service Details](#service-details)

You can also pass your custom config using the `-c` flag:

```bash
dive chain icon -c path/to/config/file
```

For detailed instructions on writing the configuration file, refer to the [Configuration File Guidelines](#configuration-file-guidelines)

## Setting Up Bridge Between Two Chains Which Are Already Running

To set up a bridge between two chains which are already running, you must have the service names of both the chains.

For ex: To start an ibc bridge between icon and archway, we need to have service details of icon and archway as follows:

```json
{
    "icon-node-0xacbc4e": {
        "service_name": "icon-node-0xacbc4e",
        "endpoint_public": "http://127.0.0.1:44444/api/v3/icon_dex",
        "endpoint": "http://172.16.4.6:9080/api/v3/icon_dex",
        "keypassword": "gochain",
        "keystore_path": "keystores/keystore.json",
        "network": "0x3.icon",
        "network_name": "icon-0xacbc4e",
        "nid": "0x3"
    },
    "node-service-constantine-3": {
        "service_name": "node-service-constantine-3",
        "endpoint_public": "http://127.0.0.1:9431",
        "endpoint": "http://172.16.4.5:26657",
        "chain_id": "constantine-3",
        "chain_key": "constantine-3-key"
    }
}
```

Run this command to start a bridge between the two nodes:

```bash
dive bridge ibc --chainA icon --chainB archway --chainAServiceName icon-node-0xacbc4e --chainBServiceName node-service-constantine-3
```
> Note: You can also pass a single running chain instead of passing both. In such case, you can only pass either one of the service name flags that corresponds to the chain.

## Setting Up Bridge Between Two Chains

To set up a bridge between two chains, run this command:

```bash
dive bridge btp --chainA icon --chainB eth -b
```

> `-b` flag is used to specify the type of bmv contract to be deployed for btp setup.

This command sets up btp bridge between icon and eth . After running this command **DIVE CLI** will automatically starts the ICON & ETH node, deploy contracts which is used for BTP and starts the relay to constantly exchange messages between the established connection.

After successful bridge setup all the neccessary details with respect to bridge will be added to `dive_xxxx_xxxx123xx.json`. For more details, refer to the [Service Details](#service-details)

> Checkout More details on how to setup [BTP](https://www.xcall.dev/quickstart/setting-up-a-local-environment-with-dive-cli) bridge

## Setting Up Relay and Para Chains

To set up a relaychain, run this command:

```bash
dive chain kusama
```

To set up a parachain in polkadot along with the relaychain, run this command:

```bash
dive chain polkadot -p frequency
```

To set up only the parachain in kusama, run this command:

```bash
dive chain kusama -p encointer -n testnet --no-relay
```

To set up explorer, pass this flag:

```bash
dive chain kusama -p encointer --explorer
```

To set up metrics, pass this flag:

```bash
dive chain polkadot -p frequency --metrics
```

To specify the network, use the `n` flag:

```bash
dive chain polkadot -n mainnet
```

To pass a custom config, use the `c` flag:

```bash
dive chain kusama -c path/to/config/file
```

For detailed instructions on writing the configuration file, refer to the [Configuration File Guidelines](#configuration-file-guidelines)

> Note: You can run a parachain without a relaychain only in testnet and mainnet networks.

> Note: The default network type is localnet.

# Configuration File Guidelines

You can also pass custom config using the -c flag for chains that support custom config. 

For **cosmos chain (Archway/Neutron)**, the config file is as follows:

```json
{
    "chain_id": "archway-node-0",
    "key": "archway-node-0-key",
    "password": "password"
}
```

For **Icon chain**, the config file is as follows:

```json
{
  "p2p_listen_address": "7080",
  "p2p_address": "8080",
  "cid": "0xacbc4e"
}
```

For **Polkadot/Kusama**, the config file is as follows:

> Note: The service files are named as `services_xxxx_xxxx123xx.json` and `dive_xxxx_xxxx123xx.json` for chain and bridge commands respectively.

> Note: The file names for both chain and bridge commands contain the name of the enclave and the short UUID of the enclave. 

# Logs

The logs are located within the 'logs' folder, further organized into individual folders named after each enclave.

You can find the 'logs' folder in the current working directory.

Each folder named after the enclave, has two files:

- **dive.log** : It is created when the execution of a command starts. It contains the execution logs.
- **error.log** : It is created when an error occurs during the execution of the command. It contains the error logs.

The file names also contain the timestamp which can be helpful to find a particular log file.

> Note: The logs folder is not deleted when dive clean is run.

# Version

To check the current version of **DIVE CLI**, run this command:

```bash
dive version
```

# Cleaning

To clean a specific enclave, use:

```bash
dive clean --enclaveName 'enclave'
```

To clean all running enclaves, use:

```bash
dive clean -a
```

> Note: Using the clean command will remove the service files in the output folder. Using `-a` flag removes the output folder.

# Enclaves

To get the details of all the running enclaves, use:

```bash
